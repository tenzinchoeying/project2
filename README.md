Some of the very worst designed websites youâ€™ll come across are for banking, credit card payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or workers. Self-selected teams of 3-4 students will redesign the MyIIT login page, the welcome page/tab, and all necessary steps for achieving a specific student-user task (some examples: generating a class schedule, dropping a class, paying a tuition bill, removing a registration hold, or any other task that students complete through MyIIT). Your redesigned portal should be designed and developed according to sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.
