Some of the very worst designed websites youâ€™ll come across are for banking, credit card payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or workers. Self-selected teams of 3-4 students will redesign the MyIIT login page, the welcome page/tab, and all necessary steps for achieving a specific student-user task (some examples: generating a class schedule, dropping a class, paying a tuition bill, removing a registration hold, or any other task that students complete through MyIIT). Your redesigned portal should be designed and developed according to sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

Self: Being an online student made it really hard to keep updated with the team but I would communicate as frequently via facebook group chat. I have covered all over the parts - editing on HTML, CSS and Javascript as seen in the commits. 

Diana: She was very helpful when I needed to know what I need to get done for the class. She would reply back to me as soon as possible. She showed her knowledge on HTML and has input a lot of efforts in this team. 

Daisy: She started the CSS portion of the project and I think she did a great job. We had no trouble working on this project. I really appreciate her efforts. 

Karen: She worked on HTML as well and did a great job. We had no conflicts. Everything went well and everything got done on time. 

Overall: this group, with limited communication but effective when communicated, got done everything on time and covered pretty much all of the requirements. There were no conflicts and efforts were put in accordingly.
